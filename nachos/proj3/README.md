### Code description:<br>
We, as a group wrote a great majority of the methods, with minor changes made by every individual throughout the weeks. We programmed every method together equally and shared ideas, questioned and reviewed our implementations. Our team worked effeciently throughout the entire project and was able to contribute together using VScode live share.<br>  
Every group member contributed, for the most part, equally and fairly.<br> 

### Testing:<br>
The way we test our implementations was using all of the sample tests that were provided by the project page, and writing addditional testing files that would test different situations for the functions. From there we would observe the output of the test we wrote and determine from the specification if it behaved as expected. We believe that our code works for the most part.
