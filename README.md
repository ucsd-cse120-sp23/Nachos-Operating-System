# Nachos Operating System

## Overview

Nachos (Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System) is an educational operating system used in academic settings to teach concepts such as thread synchronization, CPU scheduling, and memory management. This project implements key OS components as part of a university-level course on operating systems.

## Features Implemented

1. Synchronization
   - Implemented semaphores, locks, and condition variables to manage concurrent processes.
   - Ensured proper thread coordination to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
2. CPU Scheduling
   - Designed and tested different scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Priority Scheduling.
   - Optimized task execution and processor utilization for improved efficiency.
3. Memory Management
   - Developed paging and virtual memory management strategies to optimize system performance.
   - Implemented dynamic memory allocation techniques for efficient resource handling.
